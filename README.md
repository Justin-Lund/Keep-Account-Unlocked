# Keep-Account-Unlocked
PowerShell script to repeatedly check if an account is locked out, and unlock it if it is
I made this for issues where an account is repeatedly locking out, so the user can continue working until the source of the lockouts is identified & resolved
This obviously shouldn't be used as a solution to account lockouts, just a temporary band-aid fix
